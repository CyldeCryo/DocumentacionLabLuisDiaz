		one of the main chalanges that was presented was telenet as i was not able to verify it thought if i was given more time i feel that i would have been able too verify it. another of the challenges that i faced was mounting the logical topolpgy in physical view as i ran into some problems with how the back of a patch panel is mirrored so when i thought i was connecting between patchpanels i was conecting them to the wrong location how i got aroung this was to just color one of the cables to diffrent color so i can tell more easily where i was connecting to where.
